List of analyses for Crossover05

* data.txt: processed data file, but the most basic data I have, including
  number of positive and negative trials, and the number of hits and CRs

* data02.r: loads data.txt, collapses across precue var, then computes d'
  and associated statistics across subjects, stim sets, and setize
* fig0201.r: plot individual d' as a function of setsize separated by stim
  set

* data03.r: fit an unlimited-capacity max-rule model with variable
  criterion using maximum likelihood
* fig0301.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject

* data04.r: fit a limited-capacity max-rule model with variable criterion
  using maximum likelihood
* fig0401.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* tab0402.r: goodness-of-fit tests on unlimited- and limited-capacity
  models from data03 and data04

* Exp1-ModelFits.r: output a tab-delimited table of the observed and
  predicted hit rate, false-alarm rate, and d' for both the unlimited- and
  limited-capacity models from data03 and data04

Utility functions:
* ComputeDprime.r: calculates d' from the number of hits and false alarms
* maxrule.r: defines a function to compute predicted hit and false-alarm
  rates for a max-rule model of search
* maxdprime.r: defines a function to compute the underlying sensitivity and
  criterion for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false alarm rates
* logLikeBinom.r: defines a function to compute the log-likelihood function
  for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false-alarm rates

* Makefile: rules for running Unix "make" utility
