List of analyses for Crossover04

* data.txt: processed data file, but the most basic data I have, including
  number of positive and negative trials, and the number of hits and CRs

* data02.r: loads data.txt, collapses across precue var, then computes d'
  and associated statistics across subjects, stim sets, and setize
* fig0201.r: plot individual d' as a function of setsize separated by stim
  set

* data03.r: fit an unlimited-capacity max-rule model with variable
  criterion using maximum likelihood
* fig0301.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* fig0302.r: plot individual observed and predicted hit and CR rates
* tab0303.r: test effects of setsize on criterion for the
  unlimited-capacity models from data03

* data04.r: fit a limited-capacity max-rule model with variable criterion
  using maximum likelihood
* fig0401.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* fig0402.r: plot individual observed and predicted hit and CR rates
* tab0402.r: goodness-of-fit tests on unlimited- and limited-capacity
  models from data03 and data04
* tab0403.r: test effects of setsize on criterion for the limited-capacity
  models from data04

* data05.r: fit an unlimited-capacity max-rule model with one criterion
  using maximum likelihood
* fig0501.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* fig0502.r: plot individual observed and predicted hit and CR rates
* tab0504.r: goodness-of-fit tests on criterion between data03 and data05

* data06.r: fit a limited-capacity max-rule model with one criterion using
  maximum likelihood
* fig0601.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* fig0602.r: plot individual observed and predicted hit and CR rates
* tab0602.r: goodness-of-fit tests on unlimited- and limited-capacity
  models from data05 and data06
* tab0604.r: goodness-of-fit tests on criterion between data04 and data06

* Exp1-ModelFits.r: output a tab-delimited table of the observed and
  predicted hit rate, false-alarm rate, and d' for both the unlimited- and
  limited-capacity models from data03 and data04

Utility functions:
* ComputeDprime.r: calculates d' from the number of hits and false alarms
* maxrule.r: defines functions to compute predicted hit and false-alarm
  rates for a max-rule model of search, and the log-likelihood function for
  a set of parameters and data
* maxdprime.r: defines a function to compute the underlying sensitivity and
  criterion for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false alarm rates

* Makefile: rules for running Unix "make" utility
