Notes on items in this folder. MCS = method of constant stimuli, when
we systematically vary noise at a fixed set-size to find a good noise
level; fixed-noise is when we vary set-size at a fixed noise level.

data1/: contains crossover MCS and fixed-noise data, with very fast
setsize cues and very short cue-stimulus ISI

data2/: contains crossover MCS and fixed-noise data, with longer
setsize cue durations and longer cue-stimulus ISIs
