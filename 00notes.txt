List of folders:

* Code: experiment-running code

* crossover01: first crossover experiment with experimenters as
  subjects; used method of constant stimuli to set noise level for
  orientation and TvL task, without any evidence of crossover

* crossover02: see above; used staircase throughout run to adjust
  noise level for orientation, TvL, and 2v5 task, with crossover
  between 2v5 and the other two

* crossover03: replication of above with continuous staircasing; only
  change is that only S stimuli appear on each trial (S = set-size),
  instead of there being 8 stimuli on all trials
