List of folders:

* Code: experiment-running code

* crossover01: pilot; first crossover experiment with experimenters as
  subjects; used method of constant stimuli to set noise level for
  orientation and TvL task, without any evidence of crossover

* crossover02: see above; pilot; used staircase throughout run to adjust
  noise level for orientation, TvL, and 2v5 task, with crossover between
  2v5 and the other two

* crossover03: pilot; replication of above with continuous staircasing;
  only change is that only S stimuli appear on each trial (S = set-size),
  instead of there being 8 stimuli on all trials

* crossover04: actual experiment with initial staircasing followed by
  constant noise level; vary setsize (1, 2, 4, 8) and whether setsize is
  physical or cued; orientation feature search vs. 2v5 search

* crossover05: crossover04 with search type mixed within blocks
