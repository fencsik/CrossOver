List of analyses for Crossover05

* rawdata.r: combines raw data files and outputs a binary version

* data00.r: filters raw data and cleans up factors

* data01.r: collapses across subjects, stim sets, target, and setsize

* data02.r: computes d' and associated statistics across subjects, stim
  sets, and setize
* fig0201.r: plot individual d' as a function of setsize separated by stim
  set

Utility functions:
* maxrule.r: defines a function to compute predicted hit and false-alarm
  rates for a max-rule model of search
* maxdprime.r: defines a function to compute the underlying sensitivity and
  criterion for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false alarm rates
* logLikeBinom.r: defines a function to compute the log-likelihood function
  for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false-alarm rates

* Makefile: rules for running Unix "make" utility
