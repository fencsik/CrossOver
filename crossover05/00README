List of analyses for Crossover05

* rawdata.r: combines raw data files and outputs a binary version

* data00.r: filters raw data and cleans up factors

* data01.r: collapses across subjects, stim sets, target, and setsize

* data02.r: computes d' and associated statistics across subjects, stim
  sets, and setize
* fig0201.r: plot individual d' as a function of setsize separated by stim
  set

* data03.r: fit an unlimited-capacity max-rule model with variable
  criterion using maximum likelihood
* fig0301.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject

* data04.r: fit a limited-capacity max-rule model with variable criterion
  using maximum likelihood
* fig0401.r: plot d' from model fits against observed data for each subject
* fig0402.r: plot individual observed and predicted hit and CR rates
* tab0402.r: goodness-of-fit tests on unlimited- and limited-capacity
  models from data03 and data04

* Exp2-ModelFits.r: output a tab-delimited table of the observed and
  predicted hit rate, false-alarm rate, and d' for both the unlimited- and
  limited-capacity models from data03 and data04

Utility functions:
* maxrule.r: defines a function to compute predicted hit and false-alarm
  rates for a max-rule model of search
* maxdprime.r: defines a function to compute the underlying sensitivity and
  criterion for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false alarm rates
* logLikeBinom.r: defines a function to compute the log-likelihood function
  for a max-rule model given a set of hit and false-alarm rates

* Makefile: rules for running Unix "make" utility
